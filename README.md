Issues:

* Percentage Slider is floating type instead of int - for instance, if users slide to a value between 20 and 21 (20.5%) it would calculate the tip as 20.5% instead of either 20 or 21. 

Notes:

One of the major challenges I faced whilst developing Gratuity Calculator was to make sense of the swift and xcode interface.
After binge watching a couple of walkthrough videos and practicing hands on, I was able to understand the basics. As an aspiring iOS developer, I would treat Gratuity Calculator as my baby steps in learning the environment and I cannot wait to learn more and sprint in the near future!
